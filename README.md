# Cryptography Course Project
This repository is an AES S-Box Explorer course project that contains a web application for analyzing, modifying, and testing S-boxes in AES-128.
The application provides interactive S-box visualization, cryptographic parameter analysis, comparison of different S-box candidates, and encryption simulations for text and images with statistical analysis.
