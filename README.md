# Cryptography Course Project
This repository contains a web application for a Cryptography course project that replicates research on modifying AES S-boxes to improve security.
Built using a modular architecture with Python Flask as the backend for intensive cryptographic computation and Tailwind CSS for the modern user interface, it features image encryption simulation and real-time analysis of 10 security metrics.
